# chess ai and rl

this repository is for holding doola-x chess ai and rl scripts/gui code. the gui uses SFML and can be compiled with build cmds found in etc/ folder (probably).

do not expect any skill. this is essentially a playground for RL and different deep learning setups.

current workings:

- monte carlo returns for biased reward pathing
- reward shaping to value material count and board control
- self play/integration with stockfish for different feedback loops
- a basic training script to initially train the policy network
- more that i am too tired to detail
